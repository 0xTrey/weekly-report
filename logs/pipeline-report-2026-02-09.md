*Sorted by close likelihood*

### ASANA | $65,000 | Close: 2/26/2026
**Stage:** Solution Development -> Contract (security review + vendor onboarding active)
**Origin:** Inbound -- Rachelle Tamulevich led evaluation

**Champion:** Rachelle Tamulevich, Field Marketing. Allison Hadden (head of Americas Field Marketing) is executive sponsor -- previously at ServiceNow and WalkMe (both Folloze customers).
**Pain Point:** Need scalable ABM personalization across 100+ target accounts. Current tools (manual pages) can't support the volume or speed their field team needs.
**Folloze Solution:** AI Campaign Agent for rapid microsite creation, integrated with their ABM stack. Crawl/walk/run rollout: start with ABX module, expand to full field marketing program.
**Competing Against:** Contentful + Optimizely -- digital/analytics team raised overlap concerns for scaled use cases. Rachelle pushing back with Folloze differentiation.

**Timeline:**
- FY27 budgets finalized week of Feb 2
- Vendor onboarding active in Coupa (account now active)
- Security review: InfoSec docs submitted (MSA, DPA, SOC 2, Pen Test), Vendor Risk Assessment complete
- Cyber liability insurance pending (expected next week)
- Proposal scoping call: Feb 11

**Risk Flags:**
- Digital/analytics team governance concerns (privacy, cookie compliance, brand control, analytics tracking)
- Contentful + Optimizely A/B testing comparison could slow decision if digital team pushes alternative path

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Jan 26 - Meeting: Folloze Sync with Rachelle (pricing scope, vendor eval)
- Jan 29 - Email: Security questionnaire received from Asana
- Jan 29 - Email: Rachelle shared procurement process and FY27 budget timeline
- Feb 2 - Email: InfoSec docs and Risk Assessment responses sent
- Feb 3 - Email: Coupa vendor account activated
- Feb 3 - Email: Rachelle raised digital team concerns (competitive analysis)
- Feb 4 - Email: Trey sent detailed response addressing digital team objections
- Feb 5 - Email: Rachelle confirmed "general consensus is Folloze is the right fit"
- Feb 5 - Email: Rachelle floating A/B test of Contentful+Optimizely vs Folloze for scaled use cases

**Upcoming**
- Feb 11 - Folloze Proposal Scoping | Asana with Rachelle Tamulevich

**Recommended Actions:**
Objectives for Feb 11 Proposal Scoping:
1. Get clarity on FY27 budget allocation -- confirm $85-92k range vs $72k ABX-only scope
2. Address digital team concerns directly -- offer to join a call with digital lead
3. Secure commitment on timeline to close: target signature before end of February

**Close Likelihood:** HIGH - Vendor of choice, security review in progress, champion strong, budget available. The digital team concerns are the main friction but Rachelle is managing them.

### GLEAN | $79,800 | Close: 2/28/2026
**Stage:** Solution Development -> Validation (formal proposal sent, vendor of choice)
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Ayzia Vizcocho. Reports to leadership that requires competitive comparison for approval.
**Pain Point:** Need scalable ABM platform to support targeted account programs beyond what Mutiny and Flint can deliver.
**Folloze Solution:** Full ABX module with AI-powered page creation. POC proved platform can duplicate existing pages from URL input -- Ayzia validated this during 5-day sandbox trial.
**Competing Against:** Mutiny (limited to ~100 accounts), Flint (lacks SOC 2 certification). Folloze is vendor of choice; comparison framework needed for leadership justification only.

**Timeline:**
- Security review: passed completely
- Approval sequence: Legal -> InfoSec -> Finance/CFO -> CEO (required for >$100k, may apply at this level)
- Standard process: up to 3 months; AI tool framing could accelerate to 2 weeks
- Target: complete procurement within February 2026

**Risk Flags:**
- None identified. Deal is progressing well.

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Jan 27 - Email: Check-in on sandbox POC progress
- Jan 29 - Email: Ayzia rescheduled POC check-in
- Feb 2 - Email: Follow-up on call acceptance
- Feb 3 - Meeting: POC Check In with Ayzia
- Feb 5 - Email: Formal proposal sent ($49,950/yr, 2-year, 3 creator licenses + ABX module)
- Feb 6 - Email: Finance team edits on order form (Bronze CS now standard, usage fee added)

**Upcoming**
- No meeting scheduled. Ayzia building internal justification.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Follow up mid-week (Feb 12) to check if Ayzia submitted the comparison framework to leadership
- Offer to join leadership presentation to address Mutiny/Flint comparison directly
- Push for signature by end of February given 2-week infosec timeline

**Close Likelihood:** HIGH - Vendor of choice, passed security, formal proposal in hand, POC validated. Timeline is tight but achievable for February close.

### LOCUS ROBOTICS | $75,000 | Close: 3/16/2026
**Stage:** Solution Development -> Proposal (custom package pricing sent)
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Matt McLochlin. Lean team, implementing 6sense workflows in parallel.
**Pain Point:** Need to scale ABM across 3,000 target accounts with a lean marketing team. Current approach can't match the opportunity size ($500K average deal size, $27M total opportunity).
**Folloze Solution:** Professional package with 6sense integration, ABM playbook, workflow automation. Custom pricing to fit lean team budget.
**Competing Against:** No competing evaluations identified. Vendor of choice.

**Timeline:**
- Fiscal year ends March 31
- Target: March 15 signature, April 1 start date
- Free month buffer for setup while counting Q1 booking
- Net 45 terms to align with April budget

**Risk Flags:**
- None identified. Strong buying signals (3 calls post-pricing submission).

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Jan 26 - Email: Matt acknowledged recap, regrouping internally
- Jan 28 - Email: Rescheduled scope call due to 6sense workflow priority
- Feb 2 - Meeting: Trey & Matt Sync | Scope Folloze Quote (Luke joined)
- Feb 5 - Email: Custom package sent with transparent pricing breakdown

**Upcoming**
- No meeting scheduled. Awaiting Matt's internal review.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Follow up Feb 12 to check internal review status
- Reinforce February close incentive (discount pricing expires)
- Confirm legal/procurement contacts to start paperwork ahead of March 15 target

**Close Likelihood:** HIGH - Vendor of choice, pricing sent, strong champion engagement, clear fiscal deadline. Only risk is the lean team prioritizing 6sense implementation first.

### XACTLY CORPORATION | $44,900 | Close: 2/27/2026
**Stage:** Proposal (SF) -- actual: Solution Development (new director reshaping priorities)
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Molly Clouse (existing contact). Lauren Dennison (new Senior Director, 3 weeks in) is the new decision-maker.
**Pain Point:** Three priorities under new leadership: A/B testing, website personalization, ABM personalization. Used Mutiny in the past.
**Folloze Solution:** Personalized ABM experiences. Molly's buying-stage personalization strategy is central to value prop. Custom package between starter and professional tiers.
**Competing Against:** VWO (for A/B testing specifically). Previously used Mutiny. SEMrush or Scrunch for SEO.

**Timeline:**
- Decision: end of February
- SKO next week, sales training week of Feb 16
- Policy shift: 1-year agreements only for new tech
- Pricing: custom package $27.5k (2yr) to $34k (1yr). Previous proposal was $44k.

**Risk Flags:**
- New director 3 weeks in -- decision-making structure still forming
- Folloze doesn't do traditional 50/50 A/B testing (core ask from Lauren)
- 6 weeks passed since last formal call before Feb 4 re-engagement

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Feb 4 - Meeting: Folloze Sync | Xactly with Molly and Lauren (Luke joined)

**Upcoming**
- Feb 20 - Quick Folloze Sync | Xactly with Molly Clouse

**Recommended Actions:**
Objectives for Feb 20 Sync:
1. Confirm Lauren's alignment on Folloze vs VWO for the A/B testing requirement
2. Present custom package pricing formally ($27.5k-$34k range)
3. Get commitment on February signature with incentive pricing

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Active engagement but new director adds uncertainty. A/B testing gap is a risk. End-of-Feb timeline is tight given the leadership transition.

---

### AB INITIO SOFTWARE (Direct) | $134,100 | Close: 4/4/2026
**Stage:** Solution Development (SF) -- actual: Solution Development (converting from token to direct)
**Origin:** Agency referral (Agent3 token program)

**Champion:** Unknown direct contact. Account managed through Agent3 (Steve O'Neil).
**Pain Point:** Client loves Folloze concept but slow on signatures.
**Folloze Solution:** Converting from agency token program to direct enterprise customer with full platform access.
**Competing Against:** Unknown

**Timeline:**
- Converting from token account to direct customer (Candace's account)
- Free hub designs completed despite lack of brand guidelines
- Agent3 account director actively nudging for contract completion

**Risk Flags:**
- Slow signature process -- contract execution dragging
- No brand guidelines provided, building without full client engagement

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Jan 26 - Meeting (internal): Discussed with Steve O'Neil at Agent3 -- need Campaign Builder + GenAI enabled

**Upcoming**
- No meeting scheduled with AB Initio directly.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Coordinate with Candace on direct outreach strategy
- Set deadline with Agent3 Steve to push contract completion
- Consider having Etai or Luke escalate if signature continues to stall

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Client is committed to the platform but the conversion from agency token to direct is bureaucratic and slow. $134k makes this worth pushing hard.

---

### AWS | $80,000 | Close: 5/29/2026
**Stage:** Meeting Booked (SF) -> Discovery (NDA exchanged, stakeholders identified, demo scheduled)
**Origin:** Inbound -- Qin Tang (Sr Product Manager - Tech, AWS) reached out

**Champion:** Qin Tang, Sr Product Manager - Tech, AWS. Bringing 3 stakeholders: Joe (UK-based, Global ABM Manager, 8 yrs at AWS), Nicole (Global Head of ABM Solutions & Implementations), and additional Head of NA Martech and Head of NA ABM.
**Pain Point:** Scaling a successful 100-account targeted ABM program to significantly more accounts.
**Folloze Solution:** Enterprise ABM platform to scale personalized experiences across AWS's expanded account targeting.
**Competing Against:** Unknown

**Timeline:**
- NDA sent (Qin sent mutual NDA, routed to Etai for execution)
- Demo: Feb 10, 11:30am CT with 3 AWS stakeholders + Helen and David
- Internal prep: Feb 9 AWS Prep with David

**Risk Flags:**
- NDA execution pending -- could delay deeper engagement
- Early stage; large enterprise procurement could be lengthy

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Feb 4 - Email: Qin proposed demo with stakeholders, shared background on ABM program
- Feb 4 - Email: NDA request and exchange
- Feb 5 - Email: Qin sent mutual NDA, Trey confirmed Folloze can support 100% of needs

**Upcoming**
- Feb 9 - [Internal] AWS Prep with David Brutman
- Feb 10 - Folloze Demo | AWS with Qin Tang, Joe (UK), Nicole + Helen, David

**Recommended Actions:**
Objectives for Feb 10 Demo:
1. Confirm NDA is executed before demo (check with Etai)
2. Show scaled ABM examples relevant to AWS's 100+ account program
3. Understand procurement timeline and budget cycle at AWS
4. Identify if this is a marketing team purchase or a product/platform purchase

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Strong inbound signal from senior ABM leadership, but AWS procurement is notoriously slow. The $80k SF amount is a placeholder; actual deal size could be much larger given the enterprise scale.

---

### iMANAGE | $80,000 | Close: 5/29/2026
**Stage:** Identify (SF) -> Discovery (intro completed, demo scheduled)
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Rajiv Chidambaram. Marketing Ops owns tech stack.
**Pain Point:** Marketo pages workable for few 1:1 programs but not scalable to ~1,000 small/mid-size law firm targets. Demandbase intent signal accuracy issues. Need better way to reach small/mid segment firms for "Aski" AI assistant product push.
**Folloze Solution:** Scalable personalized microsites for 1,000+ account targeting. Replace manual Marketo page builds with automated personalization at scale.
**Competing Against:** Marketo (current, limited scale), Demandbase (struggled with accuracy)

**Timeline:**
- Demo: Feb 12, 12pm CT
- Two-week decision timeline for business case evaluation
- Rajiv to include Demand Gen team in follow-up

**Risk Flags:**
- None identified. Good initial engagement.

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Feb 5 - Meeting: Intro call with Rajiv (Trey + Giorgio)
- Feb 5 - Email: Follow-up with synopsis and resource center. Captured pain points: Marketo not scalable, Demandbase accuracy issues, ~1,000 target accounts in small/mid segments.

**Upcoming**
- Feb 12 - Folloze Demo | iManage with Rajiv Chidambaram

**Recommended Actions:**
Objectives for Feb 12 Demo:
1. Show law firm industry examples and 1:1 account personalization at scale
2. Get Demand Gen team buy-in during the demo
3. Understand budget cycle and procurement process
4. Push for 2-week business case timeline commitment

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Strong first meeting, clear pain points, demo scheduled quickly. Two-week decision timeline is ambitious but signals real intent. 90% market share in their segment means healthy budget likely.

---

### NJORD | $78,000 | Close: 2/19/2026
**Stage:** Proposal (SF) -> RISK: Deal effectively lost
**Origin:** Partner -- Njord is a consulting/services firm

**Champion:** Jonas (CEO) was sponsor. Felix (marketing) rejected Folloze.
**Pain Point:** Was evaluating Folloze for internal marketing and as integration into Njord's product offering.
**Folloze Solution:** Campaign platform for internal use + potential product integration.
**Competing Against:** Webflow (Felix rebuilt CMS on it), HubSpot (handles 85% of current needs), custom-built LLM for ads/email.

**Timeline:**
- Close date of 2/19 is unrealistic given current status
- Christopher needs 3-4 months for product roadmap priorities before integration

**Risk Flags:**
- Felix decided against Folloze, prefers Webflow
- Internal standoff: product wants marketing to test first, marketing refuses unless mandated
- Repeated price drops ($78k -> $20k starter) weakened negotiating position
- Luke concerned about positioning; considering breakup email

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Feb 2 - Meeting: Brief chat with Jonas and Christopher
- Feb 5 - Meeting (internal): Luke/Trey prep for Mark/Felix call
- Feb 6 - Meeting: Trey, Mark & Felix Folloze Sync -- Felix said no
- Feb 6 - Meeting (internal): Luke/Trey quick sync -- deal effectively lost

**Upcoming**
- Feb 10 - [Placeholder] Folloze Demo | Njord (Jonas declined, Felix and Mark attending)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Luke to validate breakup email approach with Etai
- Consider Etai back-channel with Chris as last resort
- If no leadership mandate by Feb 10 demo, move to closed-lost

**Close Likelihood:** LOW - Felix rejected, leadership standoff unresolved. The Feb 10 demo is a last-chance play but unlikely to change outcome. Recommend moving close date or closing lost.

---

### DENTSU | $5,000 | Close: 3/12/2026
**Stage:** Proposal (SF) -- FaaST token for Lenovo India/CAP trial
**Origin:** Agency referral -- Tim Brogan at Dentsu

**Champion:** Tim Brogan (Dentsu). Florence Lee (Dentsu Commercial Lenovo lead) now involved for APAC expansion.
**Pain Point:** Lenovo India and CAP regions need ABM personalization. Dentsu serving as agency buyer.
**Folloze Solution:** FaaST token trial: 3 months at $5k or 6 months at $10k. Unlimited usage, 10 Lenovo user licenses. Dentsu builds experiences, Lenovo accesses data/reporting.
**Competing Against:** Unknown

**Timeline:**
- Order form sent Jan 28
- Dentsu procurement process in progress
- Florence expanding scope to full APAC (pricing options sent Feb 5)
- Goal: transition to direct Lenovo contract after trial

**Risk Flags:**
- Lenovo worldwide security review required for any subdomain/separate site deployment
- Small initial deal ($5k) but gateway to much larger Lenovo direct ($125k)

**Touchpoints (Past 14 Days)**
- Jan 27 - Meeting: Folloze presentation for Lenovo IN & CAP ABM (13 Lenovo + 5 Dentsu attendees)
- Jan 28 - Email: Order form sent to Tim, follow-up on security review
- Jan 28 - Email: Herman Djohan (Lenovo) flagged security review requirement
- Feb 5 - Email: Florence Lee requesting APAC pricing; Trey sent 3 options

**Upcoming**
- No meeting scheduled. Awaiting Dentsu procurement.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Follow up with Tim on order form execution status
- Push Florence on APAC expansion timeline
- Coordinate with Lenovo on security review process

**Close Likelihood:** HIGH for the $5k token. This is a small order form, not a complex enterprise deal. Execution risk is Dentsu's procurement speed.

---

### LENOVO | $125,000 | Close: 4/30/2026
**Stage:** Discovery (SF) -- tied to Dentsu trial outcome
**Origin:** Agency referral via Dentsu

**Champion:** Herman Djohan (Lenovo Digital). Wan Kit Hui led the ABM presentation. 13 Lenovo stakeholders exposed to Folloze.
**Pain Point:** Need personalized ABM content for India and CAP regions. Planning to use Bombora for intent signals. Current process requires subdomain creation and security review for any new tools.
**Folloze Solution:** Agency-managed ABM platform via Dentsu. Trial validates use case before direct Lenovo contract.
**Competing Against:** Unknown

**Timeline:**
- Dependent on Dentsu trial execution ($5k token)
- Worldwide security review required
- Services opportunity: 35-40 hours at $250/hr

**Risk Flags:**
- Worldwide security review could be lengthy
- Large enterprise procurement complexity
- Dependency on Dentsu token closing first

- Feb 5 - Email: Follow-up with Lenovo contact Ayan on internal conversations

**Upcoming**
- No meeting scheduled.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Get Dentsu $5k token signed as gateway to direct relationship
- Start security review process in parallel to avoid timeline delays
- Set up direct relationship with Lenovo procurement independent of Dentsu

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Strong interest from 13+ stakeholders, but enterprise procurement and security review create long timelines. The Dentsu trial is the unlock.

---

### APEXON | $80,000 | Close: 5/29/2026
**Stage:** Discovery (SF) -- intro completed, custom demo in progress
**Origin:** Inbound -- found Folloze through LLM search results

**Champion:** Rajashree Ramapure.
**Pain Point:** Building landing pages on WordPress without personalization. 6sense disappointing (accuracy issues, weak intent data). Need better qualified leads, faster conversion, improved experience with existing accounts.
**Folloze Solution:** Personalized ABM platform replacing WordPress landing pages. Integration with HubSpot and Salesforce.
**Competing Against:** WordPress (current). Exploring SuperAGI for workflows, ZoomInfo or Apollo for contact data.

- Qualify budget and procurement timeline

**Close Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Good inbound signal, clear pain points, but early stage. LLM-sourced inbound suggests genuine research intent.

**Stage:** Discovery (SF) -- deprioritized until March
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Becki Howland.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Schedule intro call or demo with Wasserman contact
- Clarify if this is a direct deal or agency deal (similar to Dentsu/Lenovo model)
- Get Helen to make warm intro to key contact

---

### ANSIRA | $80,000 | Close: 4/30/2026
**Stage:** Identify (SF) -- actual: stalled (re-org, budget frozen)
**Origin:** Unknown

**Champion:** Sam Sale.

**Folloze Solution:** Tech consolidation play -- replace multiple tools while elevating ABM program.
**Competing Against:** Status quo (existing tool stack)

**Timeline:**
- Sam cancelled Feb 4 meeting citing re-org and no budget until next year
- Trey repositioned as consolidation savings play

**Risk Flags:**
- Re-org in progress -- organizational uncertainty

## NOT IN SALESFORCE -- REVIEW FOR ADDITION

### Demand Frontier
- Feb 12 - Meeting: Folloze Intro | Demand Frontier with clopez@demandfrontier.com + Helen
- **Recommend:** Add to Salesforce as Meeting Booked after intro call

### Alysio.ai
- Jan 29 - Meeting: Trey and Aaron McReynolds
- Feb 6 - Meeting: Aaron <> Trey Follow Up

### GEA (via Orbit Graphic)

- Feb 19 - Meeting: Folloze Sync (same group)
