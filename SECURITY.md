# Security

## Sensitive files

The following files contain sensitive credentials and must NEVER be committed to version control:

| File | Description | How to obtain |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `credentials.json` | Google OAuth client credentials | Download from Google Cloud Console |
| `token.json` | OAuth access/refresh tokens | Generated by `setup_google_auth.py` |
| `.env` | Environment variables (if used) | Create manually |

## Pre-commit checklist

Before committing, verify these files are NOT staged:

```bash
git status | grep -E "(credentials|token|secret|\.env)"
```

If any appear, they should be in `.gitignore`. To remove a file that was accidentally tracked:

```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
```

## Secrets in config files

The `config/settings.json` file contains a Google Drive folder ID. This is NOT sensitive - it only grants access if the viewer already has permission to the folder.

However, do NOT add the following to config files:
- API keys
- OAuth client secrets
- Database passwords
- Access tokens

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open an issue or contact the maintainer directly.

## Best practices

1. Never commit credentials to git history
2. Use `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
3. Rotate credentials if accidentally exposed
4. Use environment variables for sensitive config in production
